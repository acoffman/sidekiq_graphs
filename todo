# TODO

- indegree as id to redis counter (HINCRBY myhash field -1)
- class method on node containing attribute names (instead of on redisgraph)
- visit each child node and decrement the indegree
- if indegree is zero then call perform

# Ideas

- Should Node be a mixin or abstract class and then we make a RedisNode?
- Would [Redis::Objects][] be useful?
- Maybe it makes sense for us to define a persistence API, and then dependency inject an instance of something to the graph instance (redis, memory, etc) rather than having them be helper classes that take graph objects
